# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS FROM THE ODIN PROJECT!
Rock paper scissors, TOP

Created this 90% without having to look things up which was huge for me. No tutorial following, just memory recall from the one i did a month a go, plus adding some newer conecpts i've learned.

Added a delay so that the user has time to get the console open without getting smacked with prompts. Excited to add the css to this so that it will be button controlled with a scored dispaly just in the browser.
